###########################################

# The HTTP server port.  If you set this to port 80, you need to run Capehub as root. Alternatively, if you want
# users to access Capehub on port 80 but do not want to run as root, keep the default port (8080) and use an Apache
# HTTPD server with mod_proxy to forward port 80 traffic to Capehub on port 8080.
org.osgi.service.http.port=8080

# Whether Capehub itself should handle HTTPS traffic.  Even if you set this to 'false',you can still use an Apache
# HTTPD server as a proxy to handle SSL)
org.osgi.service.http.secure.enabled=false

# The secure server port to use if running Capehub itself with HTTPS (as opposed to a proxy handling HTTPS).
#org.osgi.service.http.port.secure=8443

# The public URL of this capehub installation.  If this felix installation is proxied behind an Apache HTTPD
# reverse proxy, this URL should point to the proxy's port (usually 80).
com.capestartproject.server.url=http://localhost:9090

# The url of the remote service registry.  This is used in cases where there is no direct connection to the service
# registry database such as capture agens running in protected environments. This is typically true for capture agents
# and should be set to the url of a server running the actual implementation of the service registry and the path to 
# the service registry(admin, worker, etc. See the build profiles in pom.xml for a complete list).

# this should point to this server's public URL.

# The base URL of the server hosting the user tools.  If the engage tools are deployed on this server, this
# should point to this server's public URL.
#com.capestartproject.engage.ui.url=${com.capestartproject.server.url}

# The base URL to use for publishing job locations. If left commented out, the local server URL will be used.  Set this
# if you intend to support swapping servers with different IPs or host names.
#com.capestartproject.jobs.url=${com.capestartproject.server.url}

# The directory where the system will store its processed files (including temporary files).  This directory should
# be persistent between reboots (i.e., not /tmp)

# The base URL of the streaming server (ususally "rtmp://<SERVER_URL>/capehub-engage").
# ${com.capestartproject.server.url} can not be used, because the streaming server does not use the HTTP protocol.
